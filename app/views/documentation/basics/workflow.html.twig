<h2>A workflow that suits you</h2>

<p>Adding a simple feature to a brand’s website should be a piece of cake. But too often the process is hampered by long
lead times and slow feedback loops that cost the site owner time and money.</p>

<p>Using ContinuousPipe, you can actually achieve real continuous deployment. The point here is to <strong>reduce the lead time</strong>,
meaning the time from when the feature development starts and the time when that given feature goes into production.</p>

</p>

<p>We believe the typical web development workflow <strong>can be improved</strong> by parallelising the review tasks 
and automatically deploying small features into production. </p>

<h2>Integrated with your code repository</h2>
<p>GitHub is more than a code repository. It’s also your project repository. Your default branch can be <code>production</code>
or <code>uat</code> so the developers know to which environment they deploy. ContinuousPipe will do the rest with rolling updates 
to your environment for <a href="{{ path('documentation_configure', {'page': 'deployments'}) }}#zero-downtime">zero-downtime deployments</a>.</p>

<p>Using <a href="{{ path('documentation_configure', {'page': 'tasks'}) }}#filters">task filters</a> you can control the steps
ran for a given branch or pull-request. You can even use GitHub's labels to control the tasks that had to be run, or
your own custom integration through the hooks tasks.</p>
