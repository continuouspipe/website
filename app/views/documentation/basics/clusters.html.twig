<h2>Clusters</h2>

<p>ContinuousPipe's deploys effectively on any Kubernetes cluster. That means that you can deploy any application that can 
run in a Docker container on your bare metal infrastructure or any cloud such as AWS, GCE or even Azure.</p>

<p><a href="http://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a> is a Docker container orchestration tool written and
maintained by Google. It's recognised as one of the best container orchestration platforms around. Google even provides a 
managed Kubernetes cluster that you can scale by one click,, known as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/">Google Container Engine</a>.</p>

<p>It's important to know that, by using <a href="{{ path('documentation_configure', {'page': 'configuration-files'}) }}#variables">configuration variables</a>,
you can deploy different environments on different clusters. You can therefore deploy your production environment(s) on
an AWS cluster, using AWS cloud-native services, and your UAT (User Acceptance Testing) environments on a Google Container Engine cluster.</p>
