    <h2>Notifications</h2>

    <p>ContinuousPipe can send notifications about the tide statuses. This will help the development, QA or product team to have
    informations about the deployments and the available feature branches.</p>

    <p>The notifications are configured in the <code>notifications</code> section. All of them can be filter by event, as in the following example.</p>

{% codeblock lang:yaml %}
notifications:
    default:
        github_pull_request: false

    pull_request_on_success:
        github_pull_request: true
        when:
            - success

    slack_everything:
        slack:
            webhook_url: https://...
        when:
            - pending
            - running
            - success
            - failure
{% endcodeblock %}

    <h2><a name="github"></a>GitHub</h2>

    <p>When using a GitHub repository, two notification types are by default enabled: the commit statues and the pull-request comments.</p>

    <p>If you feel too overloaded, you can disable them with the following configuration:</p>

{% codeblock lang:yaml %}
notifications:
    default:
        github_commit_status: false
        github_pull_request: false
{% endcodeblock %}

    <h2><a name="slack"></a>Slack</h2>

    <p>You can send a Slack notification in a Slack webhook. You just have to create a webhook integration into your Slack channel and 
    configure the webhook URL as in the following example:</p>

{% codeblock lang:yaml %}
notifications:
    slack_to_my_organisation:
        slack:
            webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/[...]/[...]/[...]
{% endcodeblock %}

{% endblock %}
